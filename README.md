# CI/CD
### **What is Continuous Delivery and Continuous Integration?**
Continuous delivery (CD) and Continuous integration (CI) are two processes used quite often in DevOps pipelines. To start, CI is a process where each individual developer would frequently merge any changes they make back to a central location, in many cases the main branch. This way errors can be identified in integration as quickly as possible by running tests against each specific build. This helps in making sure errors can be identified early as possible, as it will be tested every time a new change is made. Furthermore, CI expells the frustration of any errors or problems that may be faced with merges on release. On the other hand CD is a process which automates the entire process of releasing code till the deployment phase where it will need prior approval to continue to deployment. Both CI and CD are linked in the sense that CI oversees the testing phase, where any change made sets off automatic testing to ensure no errors are present. CD is then responsible for automating the process by employing the new code following the build stage all the way to a testing environment ready to be deployed after being tested. Deployment, however is only done through approval and is where the CD process ends. Continuous deployment is another process in which even the deployment phase is automated and can be done so without any prior approval needed.

The CI/CD processes are completed by teams through pipeline tools used to streamline and simplify the process. Examples of popular CI/CD tools include Buddy, Jenkins and  CircleCI. These tools are used to unify teams working in code and help to produce a fast and efficient workflow/pipeline. This, in turn reduces the time and expenses normally taken to push out code. These tools also aid in quarantining and segregating faults so that they can be resolved much quicker and more efficiently. All in all, these tools work to smoothen out the CI/CD process to allow teams to more quickly locate and resolve errors/bugs, allow teamwork to become more fluid and transparent and most importantly, allow for better quality code to be pushed through the pipeline much more efficiently and with a dramatic reduction in errors and roadblocks.
